# Broadway Boogie Weggie

School assignment **Advanced Algorithms** – a desktop application that demonstrates and visualizes different algorithms, built with **C# .NET** and **WPF**.

> Original project name: `broadway-boogie-beggie` – by **Ferran Hendriks (2130858)**.

## ✨ Overview

Broadway Boogie Weggie is a Windows desktop app created as part of an Advanced Algorithms course.  
The goal of the project is to:

- Implement a collection of classic algorithms.
- Provide an interactive UI so users can experiment with and compare them.
- Show how algorithmic choices affect performance and behavior.

The application is built with:

- **C#**
- **.NET / WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**

---

## 🧩 Features (Conceptual)

This project focuses on algorithms and their behavior. Depending on the specific implementation in the source code, the app may include:

- Multiple algorithm implementations (e.g. different strategies / approaches).
- Visual or textual representation of algorithm steps.
- Input controls to tweak parameters and immediately see different outcomes.
- Clear separation between algorithm logic and UI, following common C# / WPF patterns.

> Note: The exact list of algorithms can be seen in the source code once you open the solution in Visual Studio.
